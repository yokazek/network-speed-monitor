# NetSpeedChecker

[Japanese Version (日本語版)](README.md)

![NetSpeedChecker Dashboard](screenshot.png)

A network speed monitoring tool. Measures speed at regular intervals and provides a modern web dashboard to view history.

## Background
After switching to Nuro Hikari, I noticed occasional stuttering while using WiFi, which led to high latency or unexpected router reboots. Since contacting support didn't yield immediate results, I created this tool to periodically connect to the network and measure the speed to track stability.

## Features
- 🚀 **Automatic Measurement**: Automatically measures speed at specified intervals (Default: 20 minutes).
- 📊 **Visualization**: Real-time charts on the dashboard and historical charts for past trends.
- 📅 **History View**: Browse past measurement data by selecting a date from a calendar.
- 💎 **Modern UI**: Premium dark theme with glassmorphism design.
- 🐍 **Easy Setup**: Includes an installer for Raspberry Pi.

## Setup (Raspberry Pi / Linux)

```bash
# Clone or copy the directory, then move into it
cd netspeedchecker

# Grant execution permissions
chmod +x install.sh run.sh

# Install (First time only)
./install.sh

# Run
./run.sh
```

## Setup (Windows)

```powershell
.\setup_windows.ps1
.\run_windows.ps1
```

After starting, access `http://[RasPi-IP-Address]:8080` in your browser.

## Settings
You can adjust the measurement interval and server settings by changing constants in `config.py`.

```python
# config.py
CHECK_INTERVAL = {"minutes": 30}  # Example: every 30 minutes
PORT = 8080                       # Server port
```

## Data Management
Designed for long-term 24/7 operation:
- **Measurement Data**: All results are stored in `netchecker.db` (SQLite). The data is very lightweight, typically taking only a few MBs even after years of use.
- **System Logs**: Also stored in the database, but only the **latest 1000 entries** are kept. Older logs are automatically purged (rotated) to save disk space.
- **Cleanup**: You can manually clear all history or logs at any time via the dashboard buttons.

## Raspberry Pi Operation Advice (SD Card Protection)
To reduce SD card wear on Raspberry Pi, the following optimizations are implemented by default:
- **SQLite Optimization**: Enabled WAL mode and `synchronous=NORMAL` to significantly reduce physical write frequency.
- **Log Management**: System logs are automatically capped at the latest 1000 entries.

For maximum protection, we recommend using a **RAM disk (tmpfs)**:
1. Change `DB_PATH` in `config.py` to `/tmp/netchecker.db` (or any path in `/tmp`).
2. This directs all database writes to memory, preventing SD card wear (Note: Data will be lost upon reboot).

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python / FastAPI / APScheduler / SQLite
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS / CSS / Chart.js
